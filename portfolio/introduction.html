              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p class="large">
                I don’t like to define myself by the work I’ve done. I define
                myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught,
                personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue
                challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.
              </p>
              <p>
                I love creating software. But it's not just "love" that I have -
                I also have extensive experience in every phase of development
                from designing and implementing the software solution to setting
                up the deployment pipeline (with Frontend development
                sprinkled into the "experience mix"). When I'm not working on a
                commercial or a personal side-project, I'm usually juggling all
                of the different things I want to learn and do and trying to
                figure out what of those things will I give my attention to
                next.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ever since I was a kid I loved solving puzzles. When I grew up a
                bit I fell in love with mathematics - I saw math problems as
                simple (and quite often NOT so simple) puzzles to be solved. Since
                I also loved computers, getting into creating software was a
                natural next step in life.
                <br />For me the satisfaction of solving a difficult problem is a
                reward in and of itself. Experience gained thereafter is a
                more-than-welcome bonus.
              </p>
              <p>
                Love it or hate it, but having Full Stack development knowledge is
                nowadays a requirement - a modern Software Developer needs to have
                a good understanding of all aspects of building and maintaining a
                software product, be it writing Backend code, deploying the app to
                the Cloud, managing the Database and in the end even some Frontend
                knowledge is necessary.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm a team player, friendly and willing to do whatever helps move
                the project forward. Working with other talented Software
                Developers helped me grow in both Backend and Frontend
                development, not to mention that it made me some good friends and
                colleagues.
                <br />I love taking on the hardest tasks for the sheer challenge
                of it. Learning new things not just in software development, but
                in life in general is what brings a smile to my face :)
