                            Better Giving is an online platform that makes it easy 
                            to accept donations of all types from anywhere in the 
                            world into a Better Giving account and from there, 
                            directly into an endowment's bank account. They eliminate 
                            the complexities of accepting crypto and stock donations, 
                            giving nonprofits immediate access to a young, growing, 
                            and engaged donor base through their free marketplace or 
                            a customisable widget integration on ones own website.

                            A connector is a proxy or a wrapper around an API
                            that allows the underlying service to talk to
                            Microsoft Power Automate, Microsoft Power Apps, and
                            Azure Logic Apps. It provides a way for users to
                            connect their accounts and leverage a set of
                            pre-built actions and triggers to build their apps
                            and workflows.

                        <p>
                            I worked on the back end—creating, testing, and
                            maintaining dozens of Connectors and occasionally
                            worked on investigating customer reported issues
                            using the Azure Data Explorer and Kusto query
                            language to analyze the logs. My tasks included
                            creating new Connector Actions, updating existing
                            Connectors to have more intuitive behavior and/or to
                            use new technologies to improve performance, fixing
                            major build pipeline issues to increase development
                            speed and even minor tasks like bug-fixing and
                            documentation updates.

                            that it was my responsibility to self-organize,
                            which included:

                            Five Degrees is a digital banking technology
                            provider. The service they provide is a
                            next-generation digital banking platform, empowering
                            financial institutions to enter the era of modern
                            digital banking. It was designed to provide a fully
                            automated banking services platform. There came a
                            need for a rewrite of the old system using cutting
                            edge cloud-based technologies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This was a multi-team project where most developers
                            hadn't previously worked with the project's
                            architecture. One of my responsibilities was to
                            introduce my team to this new architecture design
                            approach and get them up to speed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a part of the back-end team, I was involved in
                            developing back-end functionalities ranging from
                            RESTful endpoints to message handling logic,
                            configuring communication with the database, Azure
                            services, third-party services, and other system’s
                            microservices.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since this was a "cloud-native" platform, I worked
                            extensively with a range of cloud services that
                            handle messages, events,
                            authentication/authorization, storage. I even worked
                            on a couple of assignments related to setting up the
                            build and deployment pipeline.

                        <p>
                            FlexxPay is an online fintech platform for employers
                            whose employees can instantly access their earned
                            salaries before the regular payday; the business
                            model consisted of acquiring employers in various
                            worldwide locations using a simple, easy-and-free
                            onboarding process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was a part of the core team that built the app's
                            finance engine and the notification service that
                            supported email, SMS, and push notifications and was
                            used by every microservice in the system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This being a financial platform, reporting
                            capabilities were a must, so I spent a lot of time
                            creating algorithms for extracting relevant data
                            from the database into SQL Views and then creating a
                            mechanism for easy retrieval and display. For the
                            robustness of the system, we employed Agile and
                            test-driven development from the start to respond
                            quickly to our client's changing requirements.

                        <p>
                            Every developer on the project was a full-stack
                            developer, so I was involved in developing frontend
                            pages and components and optimizing data transfers
                            to and from the back end.

                            Valitor provides tailor-made acquiring solutions
                            with an adaptable pricing structure, efficient
                            chargeback management services, and extensive
                            merchant support and training.

                        <p>
                            I worked on updating the Valitor's multi-solution
                            system to process American Express (AMEX) payments.
                            To accomplish that, it was necessary to enable AMEX
                            as a payment option in the Valitor's boarding
                            system, to integrate it with the AMEX API and their
                            SFTP server, and to update the Valitor's system to
                            be able to process AMEX payment files.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was important to Valitor this was done as soon as
                            possible since AMEX was planning on halting all
                            pending integrations for a couple of months. For
                            Valitor, this would have meant a potential loss of
                            revenue.

                            After introducing myself to the Valitor's existing
                            system and the requirements, I designed and
                            developed AMEX-compatible file generation and
                            processing services and an appropriate database
                            schema, which I integrated into the system. Together
                            with a teammate and AMEX technicians, I coordinated
                            a successful integration between AMEX's and
                            Valitor's system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All of this was done much sooner than Valitor
                            expected and turned out to be one of the fastest
                            integrations in entire AMEX's history.

                        <p>
                            ToPyString is a .NET System.Collections extension
                            for converting collections to string in Python
                            format.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I single-handedly designed and implemented the
                            library to be lightweight, simple, and intuitive to
                            use and be compatible with both the .NET Framework
                            and .NET Core.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I developed the library and created the build and
                            release pipelines using Git workflows to
                            automatically ad necessary tags, convert the project
                            to a NuGet package, and deploy it to NuGet Gallery.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The library is also optimized and covered with unit
                            tests.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of my focuses was to provide a good user
                            experience with this library, so I created a
                            detailed documentation rich with examples.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also ran a small-scale marketing campaign to
                            advertise the newly created library, which resulted
                            in more than 4,400 NuGet downloads.
